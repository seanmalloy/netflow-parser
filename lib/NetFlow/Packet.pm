=head1 DESCRIPTION

Object oriented module for storing and accessing Netflow version
5 flow packets. Only provides a constructor and accessor methods. This
module is meant to be used with NetFlow::Flow and NetFlow::Parser.

=head1 SEE ALSO

NetFlow::Flow and NetFlow::Parser.

=head1 BUGS

No known bugs at this time.
